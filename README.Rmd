I am so excited, delighted, and honored to be speaking at [PlotCon 2016](https://plotcon.plot.ly/).  This repo will serve as my open space for preparation, and as with all my repos, I welcome feedback, contributions, advice.  I am scheduled between Jenny Bryan and Hadley Wickham, so I need to really bring it.

## Ugly First Draft of Slides

I like to start ugly.


```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
imgs <- list.files("./images")


noquote(
  paste0(
    lapply(
      imgs,
      function(img){
        sprintf(
          "<img src='./images/%s' style = 'transform=rotate(90deg);'></img>",
          img
        )
      }
    ),
    collapse = "</br>"
  )
)
```
